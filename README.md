This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It powers the website for Jake Hyde.

## Project Structure

- `/pages`: Contains React pages.
- `/pages/api`: API routes.
- `/components`: Reusable UI components.
- `/public`: Static assets.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
