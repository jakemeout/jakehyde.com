However, I've realized this is a great opportunity to start blogging as well. So here you go! 2023 is starting off to be a wonderful new year. I had COVID for the last week to end 2022, which is fitting isn't it? It is an exciting new start to be a better version of oneself, and I for one, am very ready to be a better version. A Jake 2.0 if you will. No, I seriously am not referencing the TV show, that Jake is a bitch, I am the real deal :p. Any way cheers to the new year, cheers to new you, and cheers to leveling up!!!",
